# Car Insurance Risk Analytics and Marketing Optimization

## Project Overview
This project is developed to support AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) in enhancing car insurance planning and marketing strategies. The goal is to analyze historical insurance claim data to identify low-risk customer segments, optimize premium pricing, and improve overall marketing strategies. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and predictive modeling, the project aims to provide actionable insights for ACIS to attract new clients by offering personalized premium reductions based on customer risk profiles.

## Key Objectives
Analyze historical insurance claim data to understand factors influencing premiums and claims.

Identify low-risk customer segments for potential premium reductions.

Optimize ACIS's marketing strategy by developing segmentation and predictive models.

Implement a reproducible and auditable data pipeline using Data Version Control (DVC).

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key tasks:

### Data Collection and Preprocessing
Acquisition of relevant data such as TotalPremium, TotalClaims, and vehicle/customer characteristics.

Data cleaning (handling missing values, correcting data types, filtering outliers).

Storage of cleaned datasets for analysis and modeling.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical Profiling
Univariate and bivariate analyses to uncover distributions and relationships.

Visualization of key variables to highlight trends and patterns.

Identification of statistically significant factors impacting premiums and claims.

### Data Version Control and Pipeline Structuring
Setup of DVC for dataset tracking and versioning.

Modular structuring of the pipeline to support experimentation and reproducibility.

### Predictive Modeling and Statistical Validation
Development of classification models to predict claim likelihood.

Segmentation of customers based on predicted risk levels.

Statistical validation of hypotheses related to gender, location, and other features.

Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, recall, and ROC-AUC.
