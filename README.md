# Car Insurance Risk Analytics and Marketing Optimization

## Project Overview
This project is developed to support AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS) in enhancing car insurance planning and marketing strategies. The goal is to analyze historical insurance claim data to identify low-risk customer segments, optimize premium pricing, and improve overall marketing strategies. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical testing, and predictive modeling, the project aims to provide actionable insights for ACIS to attract new clients by offering personalized premium reductions based on customer risk profiles.

## Key Objectives
Analyze historical insurance claim data to understand factors influencing premiums and claims.

Identify low-risk customer segments for potential premium reductions.

Optimize ACIS's marketing strategy by developing segmentation and predictive models.

Implement a reproducible and auditable data pipeline using Data Version Control (DVC).

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key tasks:

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

Gather historical insurance data (including TotalPremium, TotalClaims, and vehicle-related features).

Clean and preprocess the data (handling missing values, correcting data types, etc.).

Store cleaned data for further analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical Profiling

Perform univariate and bivariate analyses to uncover key trends and correlations.

Visualize distributions of numerical variables and relationships between features.

Identify significant factors influencing premiums and claims.

### Data Version Control and Pipeline Structuring (DVC)

Set up DVC to version control datasets and ensure reproducibility.

Structure data pipeline for modular and iterative analysis and modeling.

Predictive Modeling and Statistical Validation

Build predictive models to identify low-risk segments and optimize premium pricing.

Validate key hypotheses regarding risk drivers using statistical tests.

Evaluate models for accuracy and effectiveness in predicting insurance claims.

## Technologies and Tools Used
* Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

* DVC (Data Version Control): For versioning datasets and ensuring reproducibility of the analysis.

* Jupyter Notebook: To create reproducible and interactive notebooks for data analysis.

* GitHub: For version control and collaboration.

## Future Work
Statistically validate risk drivers (e.g., geographical and vehicle characteristics) for the basis of segmentation.

Develop predictive models to create a dynamic pricing system based on risk factors.
